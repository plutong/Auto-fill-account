# Auto-fill-account
Hi, there. I'm a guy fond of bookkeeping and see how much I'm spending. However, I feel tired of manually calculating my accounts and entering them into Excel sheets. I wrote a Jupyter Notebook to automatically renew my account and keep track of it. There's still much for me to update this program. If you have the same hobbies, feel free to apply them to your personal account!
